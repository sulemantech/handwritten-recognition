# MNIST Digit Recognition with TensorFlow

This project trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. It includes scripts for training, testing, and converting the model to TensorFlow Lite (TFLite).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repo_url>
   cd <repo_name>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Training the Model
Run the following script to train the model:
```sh
python train_model.py
```
This will:
- Load the MNIST dataset
- Normalize the data
- Train the CNN model
- Save the trained model as `digits_recognition_cnn.h5`

## Testing the Model
To run the trained model on test data:
```sh
python test_model.py
```
This will:
- Load the saved model
- Predict test images
- Display the results

## Convert Model to TensorFlow Lite
To convert the trained model to TensorFlow Lite format:
```sh
python convert_tflite.py
```
This will create `digits_recognition_cnn.tflite` for deployment on edge devices.
